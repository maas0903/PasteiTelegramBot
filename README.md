# PasteiTelegramBot
Raspberry Pi Java application developed in NetBeans to use a Telegram bot to switch GPIO02 on or off, get public ip address or take a webcam picture and sent it back.

The command are "On", "Off", "Ip" or "Pic".

Naturally the switching of GPIO02 can be used to drive a relay to switch whatever on and off.
